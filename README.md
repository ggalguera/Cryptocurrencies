# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
This exercise involves using unsupervised learning techniques to analyze a dataset of cryptocurrencies and create a classification system for a new investment portfolio. 

## Description
The task involves four technical analysis parts:
### Part 1 requires preprocessing the data to prepare it for use with principal component analysis (PCA).
### Part 2 involves using PCA to reduce the dimensions of the data.
### Part 3 requires using a clustering algorithm, specifically K-means, to group the cryptocurrencies based on their similarities.
### Part 4 involves visualizing the results of the clustering to communicate the findings to the client.

## Summary
The client, Accountability Accounting, is interested in offering a cryptocurrency investment portfolio, but lacks the necessary understanding of the market. The data provided for analysis is not ideal and will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what the client is looking for, unsupervised learning is used to group the cryptocurrencies based on their similarities. The report will include a classification system for the cryptocurrencies on the trading market and data visualizations to communicate the findings to the board.

## Conclusion
The results of this exercise show that the K-means algorithm was able to identify four distinct clusters within the dataset of cryptocurrencies. The scatter plot of the scaled TotalCoinsMined and TotalCoinSupply columns indicates that there is a positive correlation between these two variables, with a concentration of points in the lower-left region of the plot indicating that most cryptocurrencies have a relatively low supply and a relatively low amount mined. Overall, the exercise demonstrates the usefulness of clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques in analyzing complex datasets such as those of cryptocurrencies.
